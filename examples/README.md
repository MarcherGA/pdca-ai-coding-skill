# PDCA Examples

Real-world examples of using the PDCA framework for AI-assisted coding.

## 📚 Available Examples

### [Session Log Example](session-log-example.md)
Complete session log showing JWT authentication implementation:
- Full 2.5 hour PDCA session
- Analysis, planning, implementation notes
- Interventions and deviations documented
- Retrospective with concrete improvements
- Quality metrics tracked

**What you'll learn:**
- How to structure session notes
- When to intervene with AI
- How to conduct retrospectives
- What good metrics look like

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

### Full PDCA (Complex Tasks)
- **New feature with cross-system integration**
  - Example: Payment gateway integration
  - Duration: 2-3 hours
  - All 5 phases fully utilized

- **Architectural changes**
  - Example: Refactoring auth system
  - Duration: 2-3 hours
  - Heavy analysis and planning

- **Novel problem domains**
  - Example: Implementing WebSocket support
  - Duration: 2-3 hours
  - Multiple alternative approaches considered

### Lightweight PDCA (Simple Tasks)
- **Implementing an interface with clear examples**
  - Example: Adding new REST endpoint following existing pattern
  - Duration: 30-60 minutes
  - Skip detailed analysis, focus on TDD

- **Extending existing functionality**
  - Example: Adding field validation to existing form
  - Duration: 30-45 minutes
  - Use patterns from analysis, quick planning

### Emergency PDCA (Bug Fixes)
- **Production bug requiring immediate fix**
  - Example: Users can't log in
  - Duration: 15-30 minutes
  - Minimal analysis, reproduce bug test, fix, verify
