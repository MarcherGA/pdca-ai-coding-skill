```

### Your First Session (< 5 minutes)

```
I need to implement [your feature]. Let's use the PDCA framework.
```

Claude will guide you through:
1. **Analysis** - Search existing patterns, propose approaches
2. **Planning** - Break into TDD steps
3. **Implementation** - Red-Green-Refactor with human oversight
4. **Check** - Verify quality and completeness
5. **Retrospective** - Learn and improve

## 🎓 Documentation

- **[GETTING-STARTED.md](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md)** - Your 5-minute quick start guide
- **[PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md](docs/PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md)** - Guide for project-specific setup
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Complete package overview
- **[REFINEMENTS-V1.1.md](docs/REFINEMENTS-V1.1.md)** - Technical refinements and validation

## 🔧 Key Features

### Working Agreements
- Test-driven development discipline
- Small, atomic commits (<100 lines, <5 files)
- Respect for existing architecture
- Human accountability for all AI-generated code

### 5-Phase Workflow
1. **Plan (Analysis)** - 2-10 min: Search patterns, propose approaches
2. **Plan (Breakdown)** - 2 min: Create TDD execution plan
3. **Do** - <3 hours: Implement with red-green-refactor
4. **Check** - 5 min: Verify quality and process adherence
5. **Act** - 2-10 min: Retrospective and continuous improvement

### Quality Metrics
Track your progress:
- Large commits: <20% (>100 lines)
- Sprawling commits: <10% (>5 files)
- Test-first discipline: >50%
- Avg files per commit: <5
- Avg lines per commit: <100

### Automation Scripts
```bash
# Track quality metrics
python scripts/track_metrics.py --repo /path/to/repo --since "7 days ago"

# Initialize session with logging
python scripts/init_session.py "Feature name" --objective "What you're building"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### ✅ Use This For:
- Implementing new features (1-3 hour tasks)
- Refactoring existing code
- Adding integrations
- Any task requiring quality and maintainability

### ❌ Don't Use For:
- Quick prototypes or experiments
- Trivial changes
- Simple bug fixes (use lightweight version)

## 💡 Why This Works

From the article's research:

**The Problem:**
- AI code generation increases output but decreases delivery stability
- 10x increase in duplicated code
- Quality issues and integration problems

**The Solution:**
- Structured prompting outperforms ad-hoc by 1-74%
- PDCA reduces software defects by 61%
- Human-in-the-loop with clear intervention points

## 📈 Expected Results

**After 1 Week:**
- Comfortable with workflow
- Catching AI errors early
- Smaller, better commits

**After 1 Month:**
- Metrics trending positive
- Fewer regressions
- Faster code reviews
- Less debugging time

**After 3 Months:**
- Significantly better code quality
- Faster delivery
- Team wants to adopt it

## 🛠️ Customization

### Project-Specific Configuration

The PDCA skill works globally across all projects. For project-specific tech stack and conventions, you can optionally create a `.claude/instructions.md` file in your project root. This tells Claude about your specific tech choices without modifying the skill itself.

**See [docs/PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md](docs/PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md) for complete guide on when and how to use project-specific configuration.**

### Customizing the Skill Itself

The skill is designed to be customized:

```bash
# Extract and modify
unzip pdca-ai-coding.skill -d custom-pdca/

# Edit prompts in references/
# Update working agreements
# Adjust quality targets

# Repackage (requires skill-creator tools)
python package_skill.py custom-pdca/
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does this work with Claude Code and Cline?</b></summary>

Yes! The skill works with any Claude-based coding assistant including Claude Code, Cline, and the Claude.ai web interface.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How long does a PDCA session take?</b></summary>

Typical sessions are 1-3 hours. The framework helps you break larger tasks into these manageable chunks. You can also use the lightweight version for 15-30 minute tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I customize the prompts?</b></summary>

Absolutely! The prompts are designed as starting points. Extract the skill, modify the references/ files, and repackage. The retrospective process will help you refine them based on your needs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to follow all 5 phases every time?</b></summary>

For best results, yes. However, the skill includes lightweight versions for simple tasks. At minimum, always do TDD implementation and retrospectives.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if my team doesn't use TDD?</b></summary>

The framework still provides value through analysis, planning, and retrospectives. However, TDD is core to preventing AI-generated regressions. Consider adopting TDD at least for AI-assisted coding.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I track metrics without GitHub Actions?</b></summary>

Use the included `track_metrics.py` script locally:
```bash
python scripts/track_metrics.py --repo . --since "7 days ago"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need a .claude/instructions.md for every project?</b></summary>

No! Only create it for projects with specific conventions or when you find yourself repeating the same context. See [PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md](docs/PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md) for guidance.
</details>
