## ⚡ 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Upload the Skill (2 minutes)

1. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Look for **Skills** or **Tools** menu
3. Click **"Upload Skill"** or **"Add Skill"**
4. Upload `pdca-ai-coding.skill`
5. ✅ Done! The skill is now active

### Step 2: Your First Session (3 minutes setup)

Open a new chat with Claude and say:

```
I need to implement [YOUR FEATURE HERE]. 
Let's use the PDCA framework.
```

Example:
```
I need to implement user login with email/password. 
Let's use the PDCA framework.
```

Claude will:
1. Show you the working agreements
2. Ask for your business objective
3. Guide you through the workflow

### Step 3: Follow the Workflow

Just follow Claude's lead! It will walk you through:

1. **Analysis** - "What approach should we take?"
2. **Planning** - "Let's break this into TDD steps"
3. **Implementation** - "Step 1: Write failing test..."
4. **Check** - "Let's verify our work"
5. **Retrospective** - "What did we learn?"

**That's it!** You're using structured PDCA for AI coding.

## 🎨 Optional: Project-Specific Configuration

The PDCA skill works great out-of-the-box, but for projects with specific tech stacks or team conventions, you can add a `.claude/instructions.md` file to your project root.

### When to Add Project Config

**Add `.claude/instructions.md` if:**
- ✅ Your project uses specific frameworks (Next.js vs Vite, TypeScript vs JavaScript)
- ✅ You have team conventions that differ from defaults
- ✅ You keep repeating the same context every session
- ✅ You work on complex enterprise projects

**Skip it if:**
- ❌ Simple personal projects
- ❌ Standard tech stack with common patterns
- ❌ Just prototyping or experimenting

### Quick Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# In your project root
mkdir .claude
nano .claude/instructions.md
```

**Minimal template:**
```markdown
# Project: [Your Project Name]

## Tech Stack
- Framework: [e.g., Next.js 14]
- Language: [e.g., TypeScript]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL + Prisma]

## Key Conventions
- [e.g., Use server components by default]
- [e.g., API routes in app/api/]
- [e.g., Functional components only]
```

**For detailed guide and templates, see [PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md](PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md)**

---

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

### ✅ DO These Things

1. **Read working agreements** before each session
2. **Let analysis run** - it prevents code duplication
3. **Intervene early** - stop AI when it goes wrong
4. **Commit frequently** - after each green test
5. **Do retrospectives** - this is where you improve

### ❌ DON'T Do These Things

1. **Skip analysis** - you'll duplicate code
2. **Skip tests** - you'll debug for hours
3. **Let AI ramble** - intervene when off track
4. **Make huge commits** - keep them small
5. **Skip retrospectives** - you won't improve

---

## 🛠️ Tools You Got

### Quality Metrics Script

Track your code quality:

```bash
# See how you're doing
python scripts/track_metrics.py --repo . --since "7 days ago"

# Output shows:
# ✅ Large commits: 15% (target: <20%)
# ✅ Sprawling commits: 8% (target: <10%)
# ✅ Test-first: 65% (target: >50%)
```

### Session Logger

Start structured sessions:

```bash
python scripts/init_session.py "Feature Name" \
  --objective "What you're building" \
  --time 2
```

Creates a log file to fill in as you work.

## 🎨 Complexity Variations

**Not all tasks are equal!** Use the right version:

### 🟢 Lightweight (Simple, Routine Tasks)
**When:** Implementing interface with clear examples
**Skip:** Detailed analysis
**Keep:** TDD + retrospective
**Example:** "Add new REST endpoint like existing ones"

### 🟡 Full (Complex, Novel Tasks)
**When:** New integrations, architectural changes
**Use:** All 5 phases fully
**Example:** "Integrate new payment provider"

### 🔴 Emergency (Bug Fixes)
**When:** Production is down
**Skip:** Analysis
**Focus:** Reproduce bug test → minimal fix
**Example:** "Users can't login right now"

---

## 📈 What Success Looks Like

### After 1 Week
- ✅ Comfortable with workflow
- ✅ Catching AI errors early
- ✅ Smaller, better commits

### After 1 Month
- ✅ Metrics trending green
- ✅ Fewer regressions
- ✅ Faster code reviews
- ✅ Refined your prompts

### After 3 Months
- ✅ Significantly better code quality
- ✅ Faster feature delivery
- ✅ Less debugging time
- ✅ Team wants to adopt it too

---

## 🆘 Common Problems & Solutions

### "Skill doesn't seem to activate"
**Solution:** Explicitly mention it:
```
Load the pdca-ai-coding skill and let's implement X
```

### "AI skips writing tests"
**Solution:** Intervene immediately:
```
Stop. Write the failing test first.
```

### "Context window getting full"
**Solution:** Load references one at a time:
```
Just load references/implementation-prompt.md for now
```

### "Not sure when to use full vs lightweight"
**Solution:** Use this rule:
- New pattern → Full version
- Existing pattern → Lightweight
- Production bug → Emergency version

### "AI doesn't know my project stack"
**Solution:** Either:
- Tell Claude once: "This is a Next.js + TypeScript project"
- Or create `.claude/instructions.md` (see [PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md](PROJECT-CONFIGURATION.md))
